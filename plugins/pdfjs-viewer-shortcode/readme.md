## Invalid Block? Update it.

Older blocks will be marked as _invalid_ in Gutenberg as we add new features. You just need to "[Attempt Block Recovery](https://www.kadenceblocks.com/docs/how-to-recover-a-broken-block/)" and that should update it. 

## Installation

This plugin can be installed either directly from your WordPress admin panel by searching for **PDF.js Viewer**, or downloading from the Wordpress Plugin Repository and uploading and expanding the archive into your sites `wp-content/plugins` directory.
